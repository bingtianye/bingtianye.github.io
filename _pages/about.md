About Me
-----
I am a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of atomic physics and condensed matter physics. I am particularly interested in non-equilibrium dynamics, including driven systems and hydrodynamics. I received my Bachelor degree in physics at Peking University, and I am currently a Ph.D candidate at Harvard university.
