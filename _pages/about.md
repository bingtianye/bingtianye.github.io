I am a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of atomic physics and many-body physics. I am particularly interested in non-equilibrium dynamics, including driven systems and hydrodynamics. I received my Bachelor degree in physics at Peking University, and I am currently a Ph.D candidate at Harvard university. 

Here is a link to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SUtUnpAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profile.
